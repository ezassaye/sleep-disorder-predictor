Sleep Disorder Prediction with Machine Learning
Identifying Insomnia and Sleep Apnea Using Lifestyle Data

Sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea affect millions of people and often go undiagnosed until they become serious. While wearables and health apps track sleep quality, they rarely help identify specific disorders.

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of sleep disorders based on lifestyle factors such as screen time, stress levels, physical activity, and sleep habits. By recognizing early warning signs, the model aims to guide users toward seeking professional evaluation before symptoms worsen.


What This Project Does:
Predicts the likelihood of insomnia and sleep apnea (Normal vs Disorder)

Identifies key lifestyle patterns linked to sleep disorders

Uses real-world data to train and evaluate model performance

Offers predictions through a FastAPI-powered web interface

Helps users take early actionâ€”without needing a clinical diagnosis

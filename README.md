💤 Sleep Disorder Prediction with Machine Learning
Identifying Insomnia and Sleep Apnea Through Lifestyle Data
Sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea affect millions—yet many go undiagnosed until symptoms become severe. While wearable devices and health apps track general sleep quality, they rarely pinpoint specific conditions.

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of common sleep disorders using lifestyle data such as:

💻 Screen time
😰 Stress levels
🏃 Physical activity
🛌 Sleep patterns

By identifying early warning signs, the model aims to encourage users to seek professional evaluation before the condition worsens.

 What This Project Does
🔍 Predicts the likelihood of Normal vs. Sleep Disorder (insomnia or sleep apnea)
📊 Highlights key behavioral patterns associated with poor sleep health
🧠 Trained on real-world data for meaningful results
🌐 Features a user-friendly FastAPI web interface for instant predictions
💡  Supports early action—without needing a formal diagnosis
